	I'm currently working with this book to reconnect with my natural voice. I've been disconnected from my true voice for more than two decades, this book is
	helping me work through the habitual ways I used to use my voice that wasn't natural. I've set a goal to work on the exercises in this book for 2 hours every
	day. Having confident, authentic voice is one of the top life skills to develop if you want to succeed in anything.

	There are so many benefits of humming, you can literally heal any illness with just intention and humming. This book has helped me out so much on my
	journey of healing and transformation. I use humming to warm up to my singing and speaking and I also combine humming techniques with voice exercises to
	gradually open up my natural voice. I've explored many healing techniques during my journey of reconnecting with my true self and and I found humming to
	be one of the most effective and gentle ways to heal yourself.

	much anybody if you really apply the techniques described in this book. Learning how to connect with people will help you create more abundance in any area
