<blockquote>

<i>~The Matrix</i>

<p>"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better."</p>
<i>~Albert Einstein</i>

<p>"Follow your bliss. If you do follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while waiting for you, and the life you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are in the field of your bliss, and they open the doors to you. I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be. If you follow your bliss, doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened for anyone else."</p>
<i>~Joseph Campbell</i>

<p>"Healers are Spiritual Warriors who have found the courage to defeat the darkness of their souls. Awakening and rising from the depths of their deepest fears, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes. Reborn with a wisdom and strength that creates a light that shines bright enough to help, encourage, and inspire others out of their own darkness."</p>
<i>~Melanie Koulouris</i>

<p>"We are the daughters and sons of this Universe. And, We are Universes Ourselves, Distinct Divine Souls Who have dared to become human. We Make True Love Whole."</p>
<i>~Redvelations</i>
